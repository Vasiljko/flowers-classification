# flowers-classification
Image classification project for classifying images of different kinds of flowers. Dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition.

I have used 3 different models: VGG16, VGG19, and InceptionV3.
VGG16 and VGG19 got almost the same accuracy of 80% and InceptionV3 got an accuracy of 85% but it kinda got overfit on 50 epochs.
